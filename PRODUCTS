--The database scema consisits of four relations, whose scemas are:
-- Product(maker, model, type)
 --(model, speed, ram, hd, price)
-- Laptop(model, speed, ram, hd, screen, price)
 --Printer(model, color, type, price)


--a) What PC models have a speed of at least 3.00 GHz?
select model
from pc
where speed >= 3.00;

--b) Which manufacturers make laptops with a hard disk (hd) of at least 100 GB?
select maker
from laptop natural join products
where laptop.hd>=100;

--c) Find the model number and price of products (of any type) made by manufacturer B.

from laptop natural join products
where maker = 'B')
Union
(select model, price
from products natural join printer

--d) Find the model numbers of all color laser printers.
select model
from printer
where color = 'yes' and type  = 'laser';

--e) Find those manufacturers that sell Laptops, but not PC's.
select maker

--!f) Find those hard-disk sizes that occur in two or more PC's.

where p1.hd = p2.hd and p1.model <> p2.model;

--!g) Find those pairs of PC models that have both the same cpu speed and RAM, the size of
--memory. A pair should be listed only once, e.g., list (I,j) but not (j,i).
select p1.model, p2.model
from pc p1, pc p2

--!!h) Find those manufacturers of at least two different computers (PC's or laptops) with
--speeds of at least 2.80 GHz.
